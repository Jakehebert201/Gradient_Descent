# Gradient Descent and Genetic Algorithm program  

This program demonstrates a Gradient descent algorithm and a genetic algorithm, which converges on a local minimum in a given function
By default that function is F(x) = sin(x)+0.1x, which is a linearly increasing periodic function, so the algorithms can't find an absolute minimum
The function is able to be changed in the Main method, and can model any given function, as long as C# recognizes it.
